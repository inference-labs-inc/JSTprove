### Code Refactoring Task

**Objective:**  
Refactor the codebase to improve organization and separation of concerns.

**Implementation Details:**

subtask 1. Python - specify files for inputs and create outputs in python
Create_outputs in python should also write to files
Generate witness should contain paths to inputs and outputs files

subtask 2. 
Separate python functions so output computation comes first, then the rest of the run is separate from output computation

**Files to Modify:**
1. `python_testing/simple_circuit.py`
2. `utils/helper_functions.py`
3. `circuit_components/circuit_helpers.py`

**Key Requirements:**
1. **Input/Output Management:**
   - Create dedicated functions for generating and managing input/output files
   - Ensure output computation is written to files
   - Include file paths in witness generation

2. **Function Separation:**
   - Isolate output computation from the main execution flow
   - Create distinct functions for different operations



**Implementation Approach:**
- Consider using the decorator pattern for better code organization
- Explore other suitable design patterns if applicable

**Testing:**
- Verify changes by running `simple_circuit.py`
- Ensure all functionality remains intact after refactoring

**Implementation Notes:**
- Maintain clear separation between file operations and core logic
- Ensure code is scalable and maintainable
- Keep the existing functionality while improving code structure

<!-- - what to do?

In helper_functions.py, create a function that generates input and output files and the second one for easily and scalably parse proofs.
I want to have simple_circuit.py and helper_functions.py to clean up and make them in 2 differenct functions.
 one for input_output file generation and the other one for the parsingproofs. both of these are in helper_functions.py in utils subdirectory.
  to test it run the simple_circuilt.py to test it out. -->

<!-- 
- Which files to  Alter?

1. python_testing/simple_circuit.py
2. utils/helper_function.py -->

- what is the best way to do this?

subtask 2.

- how to do this? 

  I think using the decorator pattern is the best way to do this.
  other design pattern that might be useful in this case is ?


  - testing?

run simple_circuit.py -->


**The Problem in Current Code**

1. Duplicate Computation: Every time base_testing() is called, it recalculates outputs = self.get_outputs() even if it's the exact same calculation
2. Fixed Structure: All the code is inside one method (base_testing), making it harder to modify just parts of the workflow
3. No Caching: There's no way to avoid recomputing outputs when calling different run types


**How Decorators Solve These Problems**

1. Selective Enhancement: Adding functionality to specific methods without changing their core logic
2. Automatic Caching: Ensuring get_outputs() runs only once per circuit instance
3. Cleaner Separation: Handling file I/O separately from business logic
